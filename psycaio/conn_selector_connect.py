    #   blocking mode
    # * DNS lookups by libpq are blocking even in non blocking mode.

    # Here we try to solve those two issues. If host(s) are provided, and
    # hostaddres(ses) are not, do the DNS lookup here using the asyncio version
    # of getaddrinfo.
    #
    # Also split the hosts or recognize that a single host name might have
    # multiple addresses, for example IPv4 and IPv6, so later we can apply
    # the timeout per address. Just like libpq is doing in synchronous mode.
    # This solves the issue where the first host drops the traffic (client will
    # not notice) and a second connection attempt will never be undertaken
    # because the first attempt uses up the entire timeout.

    # recognized here and the issues mentioned above are not solved in that
